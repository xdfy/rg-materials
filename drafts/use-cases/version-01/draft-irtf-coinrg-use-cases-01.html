<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">The Internet is a best-effort network that offers limited guarantees regarding the timely and successful transmission of packets.  Data manipulation and protocol functionality is generally provided by the end-hosts while the network is kept simple and only intended as a &#8220;store and forward&#8221; packet facility.  This design-choice is suitable for a wide variety of applications and has helped in the rapid growth of the Internet.  However, there are several domains which, e.g., demand a number of strict performance guarantees that cannot be provided over regular best-effort networks or require more closed loop integration to manage data flows.  In this context, flexibly distributing the computation tasks across the network can help to achieve the guarantees and increase the overall performance.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">However, different domains and different applications have different requirements and it remains unclear and the topic of academic research whether there can be a common solution to all COIN scenarios or if solutions have to be tailored to each scenario.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">This document presents a series of applications and their requirements to illustrate the importance of COIN for realizing advanced applications.

<p id="rfc.section.4.p.1">The industrial domain is characterized by diverse sets of requirements which often cannot be provided over regular best-effort networks.  Consequently, there is a large number of specialized applications and protocols designed to give the required strict performance guarantees, e.g., regarding real-time capabilities.  Time-Sensitive-Networking <a href="#TSN" class="xref">[TSN]</a> as an enhancement to the standard Ethernet, e.g., tries to achieve these requirements on the link layer by statically reserving shares of the bandwidth.  In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), however, more and more parts of the industrial production domain are interconnected.  This increases the complexity of the industrial networks, makes them more dynamic, and creates more diverse sets of requirements.  In these scenarios, solutions on the link layer alone are not sufficient.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">The challenge is to develop concepts that can satisfy the dynamic performance requirements of modern industrial networks.  COIN presents a promising starting point because it allows to flexibly distribute computation tasks across the network which can help to manage dynamic changes.  As specifying general requirements for the industrial production domain is difficult due to the mentioned diversity, this document next characterizes and analyzes different scenarios to showcase potential requirements for the industrial production domain.</p>

Following <a href="#I-D.mcbride-edge-data-discovery-overview" class="xref">[I-D.mcbride-edge-data-discovery-overview]</a>, EDGE DEVICES, such as sensors and actuators, constitute the boundary between the physical and digital world.  They communicate the current state of the physical world to the digital world by transmitting sensor data or let the digital world interact with the physical world by executing actions after receiving (simple) control information.  The processing of the sensor data and the creation of the control information is done on COMPUTING DEVICES.  They range from small-powered controllers close to the EDGE DEVICES, to more powerful edge or remote clouds in larger distances.  The connection between the EDGE and COMPUTING DEVICES is established by NETWORKING DEVICES.  In the industrial domain, they range from standard devices, e.g., typical Ethernet switches, which can interconnect all Ethernet-capable hosts, to proprietary equipment with proprietary protocols only supporting hosts of specific vendors.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.1">The control of physical processes and components of a production line is essential for the growing automation of production and ideally allows for a consistent quality level.  Traditionally, the control has been exercised by control software running on programmable logic controllers (PLCs) located directly next to the controlled process or component.  This approach is best-suited for settings with a simple model that is focused on a single or few controlled components.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.2">Modern production lines and shop floors are characterized by an increasing amount of involved devices and sensors, a growing level of dependency between the different components, and more complex control models.  A centralized control is desirable to manage the large amount of available information which often has to be pre-processed or aggregated with other information before it can be used.  PLCs are not designed for this array of tasks and computations could theoretically be moved to more powerful devices.  These devices are no longer close to the controlled objects and induce additional latency.</p>

<p class="figure">Figure 2: Simple feedback control model.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.2">Apart from the control model, the quality of the control primarily depends on the timely reception of the sensor feedback, because the controller can only react if it is notified of changes in the system state.  Depending on the dynamics of the controlled system, the control can be subject to tight latency constraints, often in the single-digit millisecond range.  While low latencies are essential, there is an even greater need for stable and deterministic levels of latency, because controllers can generally cope with different levels of latency, if they are designed for them, but they are significantly challenged by dynamically changing or unstable latencies.  The unpredictable latency of the Internet exemplifies this problem if off-premise cloud platforms are included.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.2.4.p.1">Control models, in general, can become involved but there is a variety of control algorithms that are composed of simple computations such as matrix multiplication.  These are supported by some PNDs and it is thus possible to compose simplified approximations of the more complex algorithms and deploy them in the network.  While the simplified versions induce a more inaccurate control, they allow for a quicker response and might be sufficient to operate a basic tight control loop while the overall control can still be exercised from the cloud.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.2">Traditional company infrastructure is neither equipped for the management and storage of such large amounts of data nor for the computationally expensive training of ML approaches.  Similar to the considerations in <a href="#control" class="xref">Section 4.2</a>, off-premise cloud platforms offer cost-effective solutions with a high degree of flexibility and scalability.  While the unpredictable latency of the Internet is only a subordinate problem for this use case, moving all data to off-premise locations primarily poses infrastructural challenges.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.2.p.1">Processes in the industrial domain are monitored by distributed sensors which range from simple binary (e.g., light barriers) to sophisticated sensors measuring the system with varying degrees of resolution.  Sensors can further serve different purposes, as some might be used for time-critical process control while others are only used as redundant fallback platforms.  Overall, there is a high level of heterogeneity which makes managing the sensor output a challenging task.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.2.p.2">Depending on the deployed sensors and the complexity of the observed system, the resulting overall data volume can easily be in the range of several Gbit/s <a href="#GLEBKE" class="xref">[GLEBKE]</a>.  Using off-premise clouds for managing the data requires uploading or streaming the growing volume of sensor data using the companies&#8217; Internet access which is typically limited to a few hundred of Mbit/s.  While large networking companies can simply upgrade their infrastructure, most industrial companies rely on traditional ISPs for their Internet access.  Higher access speeds are hence tied to higher costs and, above all, subject to the supply of the ISPs and consequently not always available.  A major challenge is thus to devise a methodology that is able to handle such amounts of data over limited access links.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.2.p.3">Another aspect is that business data leaving the premise and control of the company further comes with security concerns, as sensitive information or valuable business secrets might be contained in it.  Typical security measures such as encrypting the data make in-network computing techniques hardly applicable as they typically work on unencrypted data.  Adding security to in-network computing approaches, either by adding functionality for handling encrypted data or devising general security measures, is thus an auspicious field for research which we describe in more detail in <a href="#sec_considerations" class="xref">Section 7</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.3.4.1.p.1">Sensors are often set up redundantly, i.e., part of the collected data might also be redundant.  Moreover, they are often hard to configure or not configurable at all which is why their resolution or sampling frequency is often larger than required.  Consequently, it is likely that more data is transmitted than is needed or desired.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.4.1.p.2">A trivial idea for reducing the amount of data is to filter out redundant or undesired data before it leaves the premise using simple traffic filters that are deployed in the on-premise network.  There are different approaches to how this topic can be tackled.  A first step would be to scale down the available sensor data to the data rate that is needed.  For example, if a sensor transmits with a frequency of 5 kHz, but the control entity only needs 1 kHz, only every fifth packet containing sensor data is let through.  Alternatively, sensor data could be filtered down to a lower frequency while the sensor value is in an uninteresting range, but let through with higher resolution once the sensor value range becomes interesting.  It is important that end-hosts are informed about the filtering so that they can distinguish between data loss and data filtered out on purpose.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.1">Despite increasing automation in production processes, human workers are still often necessary.  Consequently, safety measures have a high priority to ensure that no human life is endangered.  In traditional factories, the regions of contact between humans and machines are well-defined and interactions are simple.  Simple safety measures like emergency switches at the working positions are enough to provide a decent level of safety.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.2">Modern factories are characterized by increasingly dynamic and complex environments with new interaction scenarios between humans and robots.  Robots can either directly assist humans or perform tasks autonomously.  The intersect between the human working area and the robots grows and it is harder for human workers to fully observe the complete environment.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.1.p.3">Additional safety measures are essential to prevent accidents and support humans in observing the environment.  The increased availability of sensor data and the detailed monitoring of the factories can help to build additional safety measures if the corresponding data is collected early at the correct position.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.4.2.p.1">Industrial safety measures are typically hardware solutions because they have to pass rigorous testing before they are certified and deployment-ready.  Standard measures include safety switches and light barriers.  Additionally, the working area can be explicitly divided into &#8216;contact&#8217; and &#8216;safe&#8217; areas, indicating when workers have to watch out for interactions with machinery.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.4.2.p.2">These measures are static solutions, potentially relying on specialized hardware, and are challenged by the increased dynamics of modern factories where the factory configuration can be changed on demand.  Software solutions offer higher flexibility as they can dynamically respect new information gathered by the sensor systems, but in most cases they cannot give guaranteed safety.  Yet, it is worthwhile to investigate whether such solutions can introduce additional safety measures.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.5.2.2.p.1">XR is one example of the Multisource-Multidestination Problem that combines video, haptics, and tactile experiences in interactive or networked multi-party and social interactions.  Thus, XR is difficult to deliver with a client-server cloud-based solution as it requires a combination of: stream synchronization, low delays and delay variations, means to recover from losses and optimized caching and rendering as close as possible to the user at the network edge.  Many XR services that involve video holography and haptics, require very low delay or generate large amounts of data, both requiring a careful look at data filtering and reduction, functional distribution and partitioning.  Hence, XR uses recent advances in in-network programming, distributed networks, orchestration and resource discovery to support the XR advanced immersive requirements.

<li>Increasing the level of customization available to customers/tenants of mobile networks or datacenters, when compared with typical configuration capabilities.

</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.4.p.1">Opportunities:</p>
<p></p>

<ul><li>Underlying Network Awareness: a P4 program can be able to influence, and be influenced by, the underling network (e.g., the 5G network or data center). For example, a P4 program may be aware of the slice used by a flow, and possibly influence slice selection. Since some information and actions may be available on some nodes and not others, underlying network awareness may impose additional constraints on distributed network programs location.</li></ul>
<p id="rfc.section.6.4.4.p.3">Research Questions:</p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Splitting/Distribution: a virtual network program may need to be deployed across multiple computing nodes, leading to research questions around instance placement and distribution. As a primary reason for this, network program logic should be applied exactly once or at least once per packet, while allowing optimal forwarding path by the underlying network. For example, a 5GLAN P4 program may need to run on multiple UPFs. Research challenges include defining manual (by the programmer) or automatic methods to distribute network programs that use a low or minimal amount of resources. Distributed P4 programs are studied in <a href="#I-D.hsingh-coinrg-reqs-p4comp" class="xref">[I-D.hsingh-coinrg-reqs-p4comp]</a> and <a href="#Sultana" class="xref">[Sultana]</a>.</li>
<li>Multi-Tenancy Support: multiple virtual network program instances can run on the same compute node. While mechanism were proposed for P4 multi-tenancy in a switch <a href="#Stoyanov" class="xref">[Stoyanov]</a>, research questions remains, about isolation between tenants, fair repartition of resources.</li>
<li>Security: how can tenants and underlying networks be protected against security risks, including overuse or misuse of network resources, injection of traffic, access to unauthorized traffic?</li>
<li>Higher layer processing: can a virtual network model facilitate the deployment of network programs acting on application layer data? This is an open question since the present section focused on packet/flow processing.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rfc.section.6.4.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.6.4.5">6.4.5.</a> <a href="#requirements-9" id="requirements-9">Requirements</a>
</h3>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Req 6.3.1: A virtual network program should process flows/packets once and only once (or at least once for idempotent operations), even if the program is distributed over multiple computing nodes.</li>
<li>Req 6.3.2: Multi-tenancy should be supported for virtual network programs, i.e. instances of virtual network programs from different tenants can share underlying network computing nodes. This includes requirements for secure isolation between tenants, and fair (or policy-based) sharing of computing resources.</li>
<li>Req 6.3.3: Virtual network programs should support mobility of endpoints.</li>
</ul>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">Note: This section will need consolidation once new use cases are added to the draft.  Current in-network computing approaches typically work on unencrypted plain text data because today&#8217;s networking devices usually do not have crypto capabilities.  As is already mentioned in <a href="#FilteringChar" class="xref">Section 4.3.2</a>, this above all poses problems when business data, potentially containing business secrets, is streamed into remote computing facilities and consequently leaves the control of the company.  Insecure on-premise communication within the company and on the shop-floor is also a problem as machines could be intruded from the outside.  It is thus crucial to deploy security and authentication functionality on on-premise and outgoing communication although this might interfere with in-network computing approaches.  Ways to implement and combine security measures with in-network computing are described in more detail in <a href="#I-D.fink-coin-sec-priv" class="xref">[I-D.fink-coin-sec-priv]</a>.</p>
