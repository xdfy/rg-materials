	 <t>   With the growing interconnection of devices, cyber security and data
   protection are of increasing importance.  This is especially the case
   regarding cyber-physical systems due to their close entanglement with
   the physical world.  Misbehavior and information leakage can lead to
   financial and physical damage and endanger human lives and well-
   being.  Thus, hard security and privacy requirements are necessary to
   be met.  Furthermore, a thorough investigation of incidents is
   essential for ultimate protection.  Computing in the Network (COIN)
   allows the processing of traffic and data directly in the network and
   at line-rate.  Thus, COIN presents a promising solution for
   efficiently providing security and privacy mechanisms as well as
   event analysis.  This document discusses select mechanisms to
   demonstrate how COIN concepts can be applied to counter existing
   shortcomings of cyber security and data privacy.
