      <abstract>
	 <t>   The proposed 3GPP&#39;s 5G core nextgen architecture (5GC) offers
   flexibility to introduce new user and control plane function,
   considering the support for network slicing functions, that allows
   greater flexibility to handle heterogeneous devices and applications.
   In this draft, we provide a short description of the proposed 5GC
   architecture, including recent efforts to provide cellular Local Area
   Network (LAN) connectivity, followed by extensions to 5GC&#39;s control
   and user plane to support Packet Data Unit (PDU) sessions from
   Information-Centric Networks (ICN).  In addition, ICN over 5GLAN is
   also described.
