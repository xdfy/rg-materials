      <abstract>
	 <t>   This document describes the problem of distributed data discovery in
   edge computing, and in particular for computing-in-the-network
   (COIN), which may require both the marshalling of data at the outset
   of a computation and the persistence of the resultant data after the
   computation.  Although the data might originate at the network edge,
   as more and more distributed data is created, processed, and stored,
   it becomes increasingly dispersed throughout the network.  There
   needs to be a standard way to find it.  New and existing protocols
   will need to be developed to support distributed data discovery at
   the network edge and beyond.
