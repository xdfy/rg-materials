	 <t>   Computing in the Network (COIN) comes with the prospect of deploying
   processing functionality on networking devices, such as switches and
   network interface cards.  While such functionality can be beneficial
   in several contexts, it has to be carefully placed into the context
   of the general Internet communication.  This document discusses some
   use cases to demonstrate how real applications can benefit from COIN
   and to showcase essential requirements that have to be fulfilled by
   COIN applications.
